Phoebus Credits:

Fonts:
I'm using fonts from Phoebus, Bisasam, Phssthpok, Guybrush and Martin.

Tileset:
Ironhand is the creator of most of the textures used in the tileset. Mineral textures, ground textures, wall textures. I've also taken a few tiles from his tileset.
RantingRodent is the source of the mineral tiles used in this set, both symbolic and graphic mineral tiles. He's also the source of the accent removal mod that I use to free more tiles to use as mineral tiles, plants and vermins.
Hermano's tileset was the inspiration that made me start my own tileset, it's also the base of my tileset. The tiles that I'm still using from is set are many: Most trees, most vermins, most furniture & containers, most jewelry & crafts, prepared food, adventurer tile, traps, mechanisms, cloth, blade trap, anvil, thread, crossbow, hill icon, weapon rack & a few more.
Hermano is also to thanks for his incredibly useful tileset utilities.
krenshala for providing a custom tileset with really nice tiles.
From DrD_AVEL's Gold Plated tileset I've taken: most plants, the walls, doors and hatches, river & road tiles, armor rack, ropes & logs, palm trees, the body part tile & the spider.
From Darkond's Dig Deeper tileset I've taken: boulders, clothing icon, dimple cup icon, sweet pod icon, withered plant icon, tree top icon & lever icons.
